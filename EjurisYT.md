<p align="center">I enjoy working on small projects. While they may not be the biggest, they are still meaningful to me. Here is one of the projects I'm working on:

1. [MBBWQolMod](https://github.com/EjurisYY/MBBWQolMod): MBBWQolMod, which stands for Mineberry Bedwars Quality Of Life Modification, is a mod specifically designed to enhance your gameplay in Mineberry Bedwars. This mod brings forth a set of valuable commands that help you with your games.
